# Intracranial Aneurysm Detection

This project focuses on detecting intracranial aneurysms using medical brain images.  
A trained deep learning model is used to analyze images and determine whether an aneurysm is present.

## Project Files
- Xception_exp.ipynb : Google Colab notebook containing the code.
- ct_model.h5 : Trained deep learning model.
- extra test/ : Folder containing sample images used to test the model.

## How to Run (Google Colab)
1. Open Google Colab.
2. Upload the file Xception_exp.ipynb.
3. Upload the trained model file ct_model.h5.
4. Upload the test images folder (`extra test`) when prompted.
5. Run all cells in order to execute the project and test the model on the images.
